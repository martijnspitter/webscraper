# WEBSCRAPER

This is a very simplistic webscraper implemented in Go. It scrapes a couple of housing websites in the Netherlands and has some basic functionality to alert on results.

## Usage

Just run it in a docker container. Dont forget to include a .env file.

## Configuration

It should be fairly easy to adapt to search different website but it was never intended to be a general purpose webscraper.
